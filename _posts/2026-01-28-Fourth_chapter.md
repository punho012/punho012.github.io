After discussing the foundations of CTI, we turn toward CTI frameworks, models and practical methodolgies. The first topic is the threat intelligence cycle - the steps we need to make transform raw data into actionable intelligence.
So let's get started.


## Core Purpose and Value
In the previous chapters I mentioned the relationship between raw data, threat information and threat intelligence as well as the different questions that emerge when we focus on creating intelligence instead of simply collecting useless data.To answer these questions, we need a method—a clear set of steps that guide us from raw data to valuable intelligence. We have a key tool for that process and that is the intelligence cycle.
The intelligence cycle provides a structured and systematic approach to create meaningful intelligence. It offers a practical methodology for transforming an overwhelming amount of raw data into insights that supports decision-making.


## The Six Phases of the Cycle
### Phase 1.Planning
The planning stage defines the scope, objectives and requirements of the threat intelligence program. This phase includes identifying critical organizational assets, available tools and internal expertise.It also involves establishing roles and responsibilities and providing clear direction and tasking for teams. Assessing risks and consequences of potential attacks and defining what type of threat intelligence is necessary to defend the critical information.

### Phase 2. Collection
After defining the direction the next phase is data gathering. Collection can be done through manual research, automated tools or a hybrid approach. There is a wide range of sources available for data collection, including: 
- Open web sources
- Dark and deep web sources such as cyber criminal forums, marketplaces or data leak sites
- Threat feeds from security vendors
- Malware databases
- Security research blogs


### Phase 3. Processing
Once the data is collected, it must be normalized, parsed, and stored in a structured way. This phase may includes translating foreign language content and enriching the data with additional context. The main goal of processing is to prepare the collected information for effective analysis.

### Phase 4. Analysis
At this point, the data has been processed and is ready for analysis. We have threat information now.We are now working with threat information. This phase combines human expertise with machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
During analysis, threat information is contextualized and transformed into actionable insights. Analysts examine patterns, correlations and relationship within the data to understand threat actors' motivations, methodologies and potential impact on the organization. 
While the use of AI in analysis is increasing, human judgment remains the most important element—especially for high-risk decisions. AI solutions can support analysts by handling repetitive tasks and low-risk threats, but they do not replace analytical thinking.

### Phase 5. Dissemniation
This stage involves creating reports, documentation and delivering finished threat intelligence to relevant stakeholders. Dissemination ensures that intelligence reaches the people who are able to act on it.
Intelligence may remain internal or be shared with trusted third parties. This phase plays a critical role in demonstrating the value and importance of the threat intelligence program to both management and customers.


### Phase 6. Feedback
Feedback is the final phase of the intelligence cycle. It involves assessing each stage of the process and evaluating the overall effectiveness of the CTI program. This phase provides an opportunity to refine workflows and improve future outputs.

Feedback focuses on whether intelligence objectives were met and whether the delivered intelligence aligned with the original requirements.

## Takeaway
Threat intelligence is not a single activity but a continuous cycle that evolves with the threat landscape. When executed properly, the intelligence cycle transforms raw data into insights that support informed decision-making and real-world defensive actions.
