### Introduction to OpenCTI

OpenCTI is an open-source platform that allows organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. It enables security professionals to store, organize, and visualize intelligence related to cyber threats.

OpenCTI can be integrated with other frameworks and tools such as MISP and MITRE ATT&CK, making it a powerful component in a modern CTI ecosystem.

### Features

The goal of OpenCTI is to provide a comprehensive platform that allows users to manage both technical information (such as TTPs and observables) and non-technical context (such as attribution, victimology, and reports).

Each piece of information can be linked to its original source (e.g., reports, MISP events), while also maintaining relationships between data points. Additional context such as first and last seen timestamps, confidence levels, and relationships between entities helps analysts build a more complete picture.

In this way, OpenCTI acts as a centralized hub for collecting and correlating intelligence from multiple sources.

With the help of connectors and workers, analysts can automate data ingestion and enrichment, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency. OpenCTI can integrate with various platforms and tools, including:

- SIEM solutions such as Splunk and ELK
- MITRE ATT&CK
- MISP
- External intelligence sources such as VirusTotal

OpenCTI uses the STIX 2.1 standard for threat intelligence, which ensures that data is structured, machine-readable, and easily shareable across platforms.

### Final Takeaway

The world of cyber threat intelligence is filled with alerts and indicators, but without structure, they remain noise. OpenCTI helps analysts move beyond isolated data points and understand the bigger picture by connecting information and adding context.

It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence, enabling better decision-making and more effective defense. In a modern CTI workflow, tools like OpenCTI are not just useful — they are essential for turning intelligence into real operational value.
