### Phile 5. Pyramid of Pain

Pyramid of Pain is a cybersecurity framework developed by David J. Bianco in 2013. The main goal of the framework to help organizations improve threat detection. It presents a hierarchy of IOCs that can support analysts in detecting adversary activity.

Valid question at this point: What is an IOC? 
IOC stands for Indicator of Compromise. They are small signs that attackers leave behind after compromising a system such as IP adresses, hash values, domain names. IOCs serve as evidence that malicious activity may be taking place.

Analyzing IOCs is a crucial part of CTI and cyber forensics activities. Correlating discovered indicators with available intelligence, analysts can uncover hidden patterns. These indicators act as key clues for identifying threat actors and mapping their infrastructure.

Pyramid of Pain focuses on IOCs. It showcases the varying levels of difficulty involved in acquiring them, as well as the impact that detecting these indicators has on adversaries. As we move up the pyramid, obtaining adversary-specific IOCs becomes increasingly difficult. However, the benefit is significant: higher-level indicators force attackers to change their tools, techniques, or entire attack methodologies, which is both costly and time-consuming for them.

**Hash values**

Hash value is a fixed-size string of bites generated by a cryptographic hash function from digital data such as a text, file or password. It acts as a digital fingerprint, ensuring data integrity. Eveb if one single input bite is changed, the result is a completely different output, therefore it is a less reliable indicator.

**IP adresses**

 IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network. They can be used to track the source of network traffic or a potential attack. However adversaries often obfuscate their real IP adress by using anonymization techniques such as VPNs, proxies or the TOR network. As a result, IP addresses are easy for attackers to change and are therefore considered weak indicators.

**Domain names**

Domains are used to identify one or more IP addresses. Threat actors often rely on dynamic DNS services which allow them to rapidly change the IP addresses associated with a domain. While modifying domain infrastructure requires more effort than changing an IP address, it is still relatively easy for attackers to do so.

**Network/Host artifacts**

Artifacts are traces of attacker activity found either on the network or on individual hosts.
Network artifacts may include unusual protocol usage or distinctive network traffic patterns, such as abnormal volumes of data transfer. Host artifacts are signs of malicious activity on endpoints and can appear in registry keys, running processes, file systems, or specific file paths.

These indicators are much harder for adversaries to alter without disrupting their operations or increasing the risk of detection.

**Tools**

Tools include the software, malware, scripts, commands, or command-and-control (C2) frameworks used by attackers. Identifying adversary tools can provide valuable insight into their capabilities, skill level, and intent. While sophisticated actors may develop custom tools or modify existing ones to evade detection, doing so requires time, resources, and expertise.

**TTPs(Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**

TTPs represent the peak of the Pyramid of Pain. They describe how attackers think, operate, and achieve their objectives. Tactics define the why, techniques explain the how, and procedures describe the specific execution. We will explore TTPs in more detail in upcoming lessons.

Collecting intelligence at the TTP level provides the highest value, as these behaviors are extremely difficult for adversaries to change without significant cost, effort, and operational impact.

The Pyramid of Pain highlights why not all indicators are created equal. While low-level IOCs are easier to collect, higher-level indicators provide far greater defensive value by forcing adversaries to adapt and expend resources. Understanding where an indicator sits on the pyramid helps analysts focus their efforts on intelligence that truly disrupts attacker operations and strengthens long-term security posture.
